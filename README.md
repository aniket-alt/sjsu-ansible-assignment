# SJSU Ansible Assignment – Webservers on VM1 & VM2 (port 8080)

This repository contains my **Enterprise Software Platforms** assignment that uses **Ansible** to deploy and un-deploy Nginx webservers on two Ubuntu VMs (VM1 and VM2). A third VM (VM3) acts as the **Ansible controller**.

Each target VM serves a custom page on **port 8080**:
- **VM1** → `Hello World from SJSU-1`
- **VM2** → `Hello World from SJSU-2`
